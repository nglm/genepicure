Step 3: Evaluate gene-disease associations

In this module, you can find functions to evaluate gene-disease
associations by combining GWAS summary statistics with expression model
coefficients. This step implements the method described in [*A
Network-Driven Framework for Enhancing Gene-Disease Association Studies
in Coronary Artery Disease* – Mohammad, Björkegren and Michoel,
2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19030).

In this step, we assume that the data is preprocessed and formatted as
required. For more information, see genepicure.data.checks module.
